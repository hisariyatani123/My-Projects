# London Underground Network Analysis with Graph Algorithms

A multi-language project analyzing London Tube routes using BFS, DFS, and UCS algorithms, featuring C++ graph processing and Python visualization.

## Features

- **Algorithm Suite**: Implements BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and Best First Search for pathfinding
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Compares performance of informed vs. uninformed search strategies
- **Multithreaded C++ Core**: Optimized graph processing using Boost libraries
- **Python Visualization**: Interactive display showing:
  - Real-time node exploration
  - Optimal routes with tube line highlighting
  - Travel cost comparisons
- **Network Analysis**: Predicts travel times and identifies critical stations
